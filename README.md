# Course Insights and Skill Alignment Platform:
## Aim & Scope:
The project aims to develop a web application platform that collect and aggregate course  
information (course outlines) from different data sources (e.g., web pages, other systems) and  
implement an LLM-supported module to summarize the topics, knowledge, and skills covered  
in each course. Additionally, the application allows users to input their completed courses, and  
work experience, and use AI based decision making system to assess how well their knowledge  
and skills align with project requirements.
