AI-Driven Shoreline Mapping for Coastal Monitoring,Jonathan Chan,"Software development; Artificial Intelligence (Machine/Deep 
Learning, NLP); Computer vision.",5,"With rising sea levels, more intense storm events and increased coastal development, effective 
coastal management is integral to preserving and protecting vulnerable communities and 
ecosystems in low-lying coastal areas.  
A key metric for informing coastal management and answering challenging questions such as 
“Where is the coastline most vulnerable?” or “How effective is this artificial reef?” is beach width 
variability. The primary means of measuring beach width variabili ty involves extracting the 
shoreline positions (the sand-water interface) from images, such as satellite images, phones 
and fixed cameras . 
Current tools for extracting shoreline positions from images are based on simple image 
processing techniques, are specific to image types and require manual intervention, restricting 
the potential for extracting shorelines from images in near real-time and  from the extensive 
archive of coastal images. With recent advances in AI, neural networks and image 
segmentation, there’s potential for a powerful tool for extracting shorelines from all types of 
images. If developed, this tool would greatly enhance the d ata accessible to coastal scientists 
and practitioners, leading to more informed coastal management.  
The goal if this project is to have a single and robust AI drive solution to effectively extract 
shorelines from images.","The scope of this project is to develop a robust AI-driven tool for automatically mapping 
shoreline positions from various image sources, including satellite images, phone images, and 
fixed camera images. The tools could be used by people with different ba ckgrounds and from 
anywhere in the world, so it is important that the tool is simple and user-friendly. It is understood 
that some machine learning tools and packages that could be incorporated into the solution 
require specific hardware.  
The group will be provided with an extensive dataset comprised of images and mapped 
shorelines for model training and validation. The group will then design and implement their 
own solution to extract shoreline positions from images.  
The group needs to ensure the tool can handle images from various sources with different 
resolutions and qualities. The group will initially begin by developing a tool to work on oblique 
aerial images and following this the group will incorporate satellite imagery.  
The solution should be simple and easy to use, requiring minimal user input besides some hyperparameter tuning and a user-defined image source and output directory.","Experience programming in python would be preferable, but not essential.","A robust tool for mapping shorelines on different image sources (fixed cameras, phone 
cameras and satellite images).

• A user guide.  
• A report containing a summary of the options that were explored, a diagram of the system 
architecture, justification for the chosen architecture, a summary of model hyperparameter

response. However, high-throughput analysis of these antigens is still limited as it is expensive, 
and thus current software tools to analyse this data are lacki ng.  
The aims of this project are to implement several algorithms to analyse data from the Serum 
Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA) platform that can be used as a standalone package or part 
of a bioinformatics pipeline .","The students will develop a software tool or package that will parse and process the data from 
the SERA platform. This will include quality control, at least two algorithms, visualisation reports 
and processed data for downstream analysis.  
Multiple algorithms have been written to analyse this data but are not freely available. An in -
house developed tool that can be shared/used will aid in the analysis of this data by non -
bioinformatics researchers. Most of this analysis involves sequence pro cessing and matching, 
and statistical tests to determine significance and likelihoods.  
Data:  
SERA data is the processed output from next-generation sequencing of the antigens that have 
been extracted from a sample. This data is in the form of short peptides/protein k -mers (k=5 
and k=6), from a restricted alphabet of amino acids (~20 letters), alon g with a Log -Enrichment

- PIE (Protein wide Identification of Epitopes) 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10620090/  
PIWAs:  
PIWAs is used to identify antigen and epitope signals against a reference proteome. As input 
for the PIWAs algorithm, samples are labelled by condition and a target proteome selected. For 
each sample and protein in the proteome, PIWAs scores are calculated  by tiling the kmers onto 
the protein sequence, smoothing over a window of these kmers, normalizing to the background 
signal, and calculating the maximum value. Background samples might not be available and 
simulated data will need to be used.  
PIE: 
The PIE algorithm is used to locate regions within the protein sequence that had stronger outlier 
signals. In this case, for each position in the protein sequence, all case and control sample 
values are normalized using median absolute deviation based on t he distribution of the control 
sample values. An outlier threshold is calculated and then an outlier statistic. Values exceeding 
set thresholds are considered significant, and adjacent regions merged to define the region of 
interest.  
Output and data visualisation:  
The output should be the proteins (and their sequences) detected from the PIWAs, and the 
regions of interest from the PIE analysis.  
Visualisation will include distributions or log-enrichment scores, heatmaps of tiling, plots of 
smoothing and outlier scores.  
Further/exact details will be discussed.  
Depending on time, additional methods may be incorporated into the package.  
These include and are not limited to:  
- A shiny app  
- Unsupervised analysis of the output (PCA, linear regression, hierarchical clustering)","Students should know how to use either python or R for statistical and visualisation.   
Scripting languages (as simple as bash) and workflow tools such as Docker or Snakemake.  
Basic biology is not necessary but useful (ie what are proteins, sequencing) .","Expected outcome:  
Final product should be a software package for either R or python (or both!) that implements the 
tools for the analysis of SERA data.  
 
Deliverables:  
- Source code (scripts/software) that can run as part of a next -generation sequencing pipeline

received GPS signals captured from a software-defined radio (SDR). Australian Centre for 
Space Engineering Research (ACSER, https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/acser) develops its 
own in-house receiver as part of our GPS resea rch. Additionally, we also use open source 
software receivers, such as GNSS-SDR, FGI-SGRx and JuliaGNSS.  
However, a simple software bug, such as a wrong sign in one of the navigation equations, will 
lead to a very wrong position solution. One of the example of this was found on an open source 
GPS receiver: https://github.com/JuliaGNSS/PositionVelocityTime.jl/ issues/8 , where a simple 
sign mistake leads to 800 m position error.  
Other than the obvious problem of leading the user to the wrong location, ACSER is using 
these software receivers as part in related GPS research, such as using reflected GPS signals 
from Earth's surface to determine its properties, such as ocean wind spee d and determining 
sea ice boundary. These depends on correct PVT solutions generated from these software 
receivers to generate the correct output.  
To test the receivers, ACSER owns several GPS simulators. These simulators can generate 
simulated GPS signals in different scenarios, such as a stationary receiver or a receiver 
traveling in low Earth orbit. The simulators can output the truth data, allowi ng us to compare the 
accuracy of the software receivers. However, the simulators need to be manually set up, which 
makes it hard to do automated testing.

"Further Development of ""Colour Combo Rush"", aka the UNSW colour vision suite",E/Prof Stephen Dain and A/Prof Mei Boon (University of Canberra),"Software development; System/game development; Human 
Computer Interaction (HCI) .",6,"One of the problems that limits the possibilities in using computers to examine human colour 
vision this the huge variety of screens and computers is that the colours produced by any 
combination of computer and screen may vary considerably.  As a consequen ce, commercially 
available examination methods use specific computers and screens and have calibration 
procedures.  This means that the systems can be expensive.   
A/Prof Mei Boon, I and others established that the colours within a specific model of iPad mini 
were sufficiently alike that individual calibration was not necessary. 
https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0725-1.  We designed a colour vision test app, origina lly 
intended for examining diabetic children up to the age of about 12 years.  This was in 3 forms, a 
purely clinical test and versions with two levels of added gaming effects.  We validated and 
compared these versions https://doi.org/10.1089/g4h.2016.0100  and 
https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0893-7.  We then. published the work on the diabetic 
children https://doi.org/10.1080/08164622.2023.2288176.  There is a further paper in 
preparation on age changes in colour vision.  
We have not assessed them, but we assume that there are variations between models as there 
are between smart phones.  https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.33.00A300.  
We would now like to extend and improve the app in a number of respects.  
1.  The current version is designed for acquired colour vision and we would like to add an option 
to examine congenital deficiencies as well.  The colour part of it is straight forward, requiring a 
second colour look up table but the program needs to allow  selection and processing of the two 
procedures.  
2.  The current version is written for the iPad mini 3.  We would like to app to identify the model 
and select the appropriate colour look up table (we have all the equipment to make the colour 
measurements and provide the RGB values) and sizing according to screen size.  
3.  The current version sends the raw data to a personal UNSW email address (as required by 
UNSW) but that person has left UNSW and we need to look at other methods of sending and 
storing the data in a more accessible form  
4. The current version sends out the raw data, we would like to look at the possibilities of 
processing and storing the data in the app and, as well as transmitting it, having the option to 
display it on the screen.

Accelerating Cryptographic Prototyping: A Re-evaluation of the Charm Library,Evan Krul,"Software development; Computer Science and Algorithms; 
Security/Cyber Security .",7,"This project aims to enable rapid prototyping and evaluation of cryptographic schemes by 
updating the crypto-charm library (<https://github.com/JHUISI/charm>).  
 
**Background**  
Cryptographic schemes are behind every single digital interaction.  
- Websites have SSL certificates issued and digitally signed by a certificate authority.  
- Traffic between a browser and server is encrypted.  
- Blockchains rely on signatures and hash functions at their core.  
 
Cryptographic protocols expand on this and describe the interaction between parties.  
- Browsers and clients exchange encryption keys securely.  
- Users can sign on to SSH by proving they know the private key that belongs to a public key 
installed on the server.  
There is continual research and development into these schemes. For example, recent 
changes to BBS signatures \[1, 2\] are being proposed to enable privacy-preserving digital 
driver licenses. This proposal includes a signature scheme and a protocol to pres ent digital 
identities securely. (If you want to chat more about this, please reach out to me. It is very 
interesting.)  
When a cryptographic scheme needs to be implemented, we usually have two options.  
1. Implement a _production-ready_ library in a low-level language like C or Rust  
2. Implement a _prototype_library in a high-level language like Python  
Option 1 is the indisputably correct option if the intent is to distribute the scheme or protocol. 
Implementing crypto in a low-level language is not easy and comes with many 'foot guns' that 
must be addressed for the implementation to be 'secure enough' f or production use.  
Furthermore, a proposed cryptographic scheme is not static. They must be carefully reviewed 
and updated (i.e., the BBS Signature Draft \[2\] has been under revision since 2022). There is 
no use in spending the time and effort to implement a _production_ li brary for a non-production-
ready scheme.  This is where Option 2 plays a key role. Being able to prototype a scheme or protocol in a high-
level language rapidly means that researchers can quickly publish and evaluate working 
implementations of their proposals without concerning themselves with the  complex inner 
workings of programming crypto libraries.","**The Project**  
In 2011, the crypto-charm library was introduced \[3\] (<https://github.com/JHUISI/charm>) to 
enable Python implementations of cryptographic schemes/protocols. Charm is an abstraction 
on top of the same low-level libraries used to implement production-ready crypto.  
Unfortunately, Charm has fallen out of date, and with no replacement in sight, Charm requires 
serious TLC.  
This project aims to create a fork of Charm that addresses its fundamental flaws and makes it a 
viable library researchers can use for the next decade. This is a unique opportunity to 
undertake a significant technical challenge – with a wide range of skill s required – while making 
a meaningful contribution to a heavily relied-on library.  
The general goals of this project are as follows:  
1. Address general critical deficiencies in Charm  
2. Implement a new protocol engine  
3. Implement support for recent low-level crypto libraries (more recent pairing curves, etc.)  
4. Update benchmarking  
5. Update the toolkit with recent schemes for comparisons  
6. Create updated build profiles for deployment  
7. Detailed documentation (in code and library usage)  
The project's scope is adaptable to the student's progress and challenges encountered during 
the project.  
Students are encouraged to propose further improvements as they familiarise themselves with 
the project .

Verifiable Credentials: The Future of Digital Identity in Action,Evan Krul,"Software development; Web application development; Mobile 
application development; Security/Cyber Security; Human Computer Interaction (HCI).",9,"This project aims to implement a complete and extensible digital credential system.  
 
**Background**  
Digital identity no longer refers to usernames and passwords associated with some website. 
Our _traditional_ identities are being digitized at an unprecedented rate. Digital driver's licenses 
in NSW have already been available for a few years. This project  addresses the challenges of 
digitizing these _traditional_ identity documents.  
As a user, there are two factors to consider when moving to a digital identity. First, we must be 
issued a digital ID (e.g., through the Service NSW app). Second, we must be able to use our 
digital identity.  
The use of an identity means being able to present it to some other party. For example, 
presenting a driver's licence to a bar to prove you are over 18, presenting the same driver's 
licence to a car rental agency, or providing documents when opening a bank  account.  
 
We use the following terms:  
- Identity Owner: who the identity is for (e.g., You)  
- Issuer: who issues the identity (e.g., NSW Government)  
- Service Provider: the entity that needs to collect identity documents (e.g., bar, car rental 
agency)  
 
The current approach to providing this functionality is centralized:  
- The NSW Government stores a record of your license in their database  
- You can log into the Service NSW app. The app will contact the government server and 
display your credentials.  
- If you want to share a credential with some service provider, you 'request' that the servers of 
the NSW government will share your identity information with the service provider.  
 
This centralized identity management system approach has some key fatal flaws. The concentration of power that the NSW Government has acts as a single point of failure. For you 
to use your identity, the government servers have to be online and act on your behalf to share 
the identity.  
Furthermore, the government is informed every time you use your identity. Do you want the 
government to know what your favourite bar is? Surely not.  
The sharing of identity data with the service provider is also problematic. Oversharing of 
information leads to catastrophic data breaches (Medibank, Optus, etc.). A bar does not need 
my name and address to know I am over 18, yet the current digital identi ty implementations 
share this with them. Additionally, a bar also should not be able to track my visits by linking the 
presentations of my identity.  
In response to these concerns, a new identity paradigm has emerged: Self-Sovereign Identity 
(SSI).   
SSI aims to revolutionize identity management by empowering individuals to take control of 
their digital identity and not rely on a centralized authority \[1\]. 
The essence of SSI lies in the issuance and verification of user credentials. These credentials, 
issued by trusted entities, attest to the authenticity of a particular attribute of a user's identity. By 
holding the credentials, users eliminate reliance on third-party data custodians, reduce the 
potential for data breaches, and ensure they retain control over their identity.  
Simply put, instead of storing our digital identity on the NSW Government servers, we store the 
credentials in a wallet on our devices. Now the process becomes:  
- The NSW Government sends me a digital credential of your license  
- The Driver's License credential is stored in a wallet app on your phone  
- If you want to share a credential with some service provider, you choose to share the 
credential stored on your device with them.  
You have sovereign control over the use of your identity. The credentials are signed by the 
issuer with a digital signature so that when a credential is presented to a service provider, it can 
be verified (hence the name Verifiable Credentials). For more d etails, see Sections 1 and 2.1 of 
this paper: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06729>.  
We can also expand verifiable credentials (Selective disclosure Section 3.2.1, Unlinkability 
Section 3.2.2 in <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06729>) .","**The Project**  
This project aims to develop a comprehensive end-to-end SSI implementation to serve as a 
basis for future implementations and evaluations.  
There is no solid, open-source, extensible, and up-to-date implementation of a complete SSI 
identity system. Having this in place would allow the demonstration and communication of SSI. 
Implementation of the extensions (i.e., Selective Disclosure) would hi ghlight the privacy benefits 
of SSI. The outcome of this project would be to provide a functional baseline implementation of 
a complex and interconnected multi-party system. The project promises a wide range of 
technical challenges, from protocol design an d implementation to library creation and UI/UX 
considerations in the wallet application.  
Good software engineering principles are key, as this project must be easily extensible to aid in 
the evaluation of further research in SSI.  
 
 The general goals of this project are as follows:  
1. Implement the complete lifecycle of credentials:  
    1. An agent library/application for issues to issue credentials  
    2. An agent and wallet (app or website) for identity owners to store and use their credentials  
    3. An agent library for service providers to collect credentials  
2. Support of Selective Disclosure when presenting credentials  
3. Support of Unlinkability when presenting credentials  
4. Sample implementations to demonstrate and evaluate, e.g., A car rental collecting a driver's 
license and a bar verifying age from the same verifiable credential.  
5. Possible support of _Identity Escrow_  
    1. More on this if you take the project, but it would require a fourth library/agent 
implementation  
The project's scope is adaptable to the student's progress and challenges encountered during 
the project.  
The end goal is a demo application that demonstrates the life-cycle of SSI credentials and 
supports selective disclosure, unlinkability, and potentially identity escrow.

Abstract: The 3D arrangement of our DNA critically influences gene regulation by positioning 
regulatory elements such as enhancers close to gene starting points, or  promoters. 
Understanding how gene expression is regulated across various cell types has seen significant 
progress; however, the study of DNA's 3D structural variations among these cell types remains 
a pioneering area of research. Recent technological adva ncements have enabled the 
examination of DNA organization at the single-cell level, exposing cell-specific structural 
differences. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how these structural variances affect gene 
activity requires the development of more so phisticated computational models. This project 
aims to develop advanced deep-learning methods that not only predict but also interpret the 
complex interactions within DNA's 3D structure. By integrating techniques for enhanced 
interpretability, our models w ill provide meaningful insights into the biological significance of 
chromosomal arrangements, making the complex interplay more accessible to biologists. 
Additionally, we will incorporate uncertainty estimation within our computational framework, 
ensuring robust predictions even when dealing with the inherent variability and noise present in 
single-cell genomic data. This dual approach will improve confidence in the model outputs and 
facilitate a deeper understanding of the dynamic 3D genome architecture's role in cell-specific 
gene regulation.  
 
Resources: We have access to 3D genome organization data from more than 50 samples. We 
have also local high-performance  GPU and CPU computing systems in UNSW Biomedical  
Machine Learning Lab.  
 
The skills required for project(s): Scripting experience in Python.
